### StringHandling

This program reads in a string and makes each alternate character an UPPERCASE character and each other
alternate character a lowercase character (e.g, the string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”).

Starting with the same string but making each alternative word lower and upper case (e.g. the string: “I am learning to code” would
become “i AM learning TO code”). The split and join functions are used to achieve this.
